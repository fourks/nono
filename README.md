#### 4-channel nanoloop inspired midi sequencer for monome norns
###### by 0F.digital

*please note: this is my first norns/lua project, so the code is no doubt messy. i'm still learning!*

outputs on midi channels 1 to 4, as well as basic internal voice (PolyPerc).

controls are shown on-screen, but here they are for clarity:

### global

key1: pattern/file view

enc1: tempo

### pattern view

key2: add/cut/paste note

key3: cycle channel

enc2: edit position

key2+enc2: select note

key3+enc1: channel length

key3+enc2: transpose channel

key3+enc3: shift(rotate) notes on channel

### file view

key2: save selected channel pattern

key3: load selected channel pattern

enc2: select pattern

enc3: select channel

thanks to oliver wittchow for making inspiring sequencing interfaces.
